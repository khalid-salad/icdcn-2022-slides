\begin{frame}{Bor\r{u}vka-Style Algorithm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item we present a deterministic algorithm similar to Bor\r{u}vka's
        \item a quick review of Bor\r{u}vka's
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item each machine stores a disjoint-set (union-find) $\mathcal{M}$
                  \item algorithm works in ``phases''
                  \item in each phase:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item an MOE is found for each fragment
                            \item fragments are merged along MOEs
                        \end{itemize}
                  \item when exactly \alert{one} fragment remains, it forms an MST
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Algorithm 1}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item each phase consists of two steps
%               \begin{itemize}
%                   \item for any node $v$ in $M$, $M$ iterates through the adjacency
%                         list of $v$ and performs \textproc{Find} until it finds an edge belonging
%                         to another fragment, after which it broadcasts this MOE
%                   \item $M$ merges fragments: if $(u, v)$ is an MOE, $M$ updates $\mathcal{M}$ with $\Call{Union}{u, v}$.
%               \end{itemize}
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Algorithm}
    \begin{itemize}
        % \item can improve $\lcc$
        \item rather than broadcasting MOEs, simulate unicast version (as in GHS)
        \item additionally, we filter to reduce the number of edges in each machine to $\bigO{n}$
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item machines create MSFs of their local subgraphs using Kruskal's
                  \item ``discard'' edges that are not part of local MSF
                  \item the remaining (at most $k(n-1)$ edges whp) are the only MST edges reamining
              \end{itemize}
        \item algorithm then continues on remaining subgraphs
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Algorithm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for a fixed machine $M$ and fragment $f$, $M$ determines the
              \alert{Local Minimum Outgoing Edge} (LOE) and broadcasts
              % \item set $\texttt{LOE} = \infty$
              %       \begin{itemize}
              %           \item iterate through edges in $f$ --- for edge $(u, v)$ with $u$ in $M$, send a message to the machine containing $v$ with IDs of $u$ and $v$ and fragment ID of $f$
              %           \item for each message $(u, v, f)$, if the fragment ID of $v$ is different than the received fragment ID, respond with original fragment ID and fragment ID of $f$
              %           \item update $\texttt{LOE} = \Call{min}{\texttt{LOE}, w}$ for each message received corresponding to $f$, where $w$ is the weight
              %                 of the outgoing edge
              %           \item broadcast the \texttt{LOE} and fragment ID
              %       \end{itemize}
        \item from the broadcast of the \texttt{LOE}s, each machine locally determines the global MOE for any fragment it contains
        \item the machine then merges fragments
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Merging}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that we cannot merge all fragments at once, as that takes time proportial to the length of the fragment chain
        \item use a technique similar to \alert{controlled GHS}
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item create rooted tree $F$ --- each node is a fragment and there is an edge between nodes if they share an MOE
                  \item construct maximal matching (using e.g. Cole-Vishkin)
                  \item merge all matched edges and any edge where \alert{exactly} one
                        endpoint is matched
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{$\lcc$ and $\mcc$}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mcc = \softO{\sfrac{n}{k}}$ 
        \item $\lcc = \softO{\frac{m+n}{k} + \Delta + k}$
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item filtering requires $\softO{\sfrac{m}{k} + \Delta}$
                  \item matching requires $\softO{\sfrac{n}{k}}$ rounds
                  \item additional $\softO{k}$ from a machine needing to process messages
                  from $k - 1$ other machines
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
